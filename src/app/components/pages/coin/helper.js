                "What does the color-coded 'Score' represent on the dashboard?",
            answer: "The color-coded 'Score' on our cryptocurrency dashboard is a visual indicator that represents the risk level and stability of each cryptocurrency, based on our proprietary analysis. Here's what each color signifies:\n\nGreen: This color indicates a cryptocurrency with low risk, suggesting stability and less volatility in its market price. Green scores typically are assigned to well-established cryptocurrencies with a strong track record.\n\nBlue: Blue scores represent cryptocurrencies that exhibit moderate risk, with potential for steady growth. These might have relatively stable performance, but not as consistent as those marked green.\n\nYellow: Yellow suggests caution, as these cryptocurrencies are considered to have moderate to high risk. They might show more price volatility and could be influenced by unpredictable market trends.\n\nRed: Red is used for the highest risk cryptocurrencies. These are often highly volatile and may experience significant price fluctuations. Red scores alert users to potential risk and the possibility of rapid changes in market value.\n\nKeep in mind that while these scores provide a snapshot of current market conditions, the cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic, and risk levels can change frequently. Investors should use these scores as one of several tools for making informed investment decisions.",
